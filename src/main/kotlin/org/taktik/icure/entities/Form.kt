/**
 * This entity is a root level object. It represents a Form. It is serialized in JSON and saved in the underlying CouchDB database.
 *
 * A form is used to visually structure medical information pertaining to one or several healthcare elements and collected on the course of a series of contacts.
 * Forms are organised in a hierarchy. They are the building blocks of a folder structure, of input forms or dashboards.
 * Contacts' services are linked to forms by means of the sub-contacts.
 *
 * A Form conforms to a series of interfaces:
 * - StoredICureDocument
 * - Encryptable
 *
 * @property id The Id of the form. We encourage using either a v4 UUID or a HL7 Id.
 * @property rev The revision of the form in the database, used for conflict management / optimistic locking.
 * @property created The timestamp (unix epoch in ms) of creation of the form, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @property modified The date (unix epoch in ms) of the latest modification of the form, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @property author The id of the User that has created this form, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @property responsible The id of the healthcare party that is responsible for this form, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @property medicalLocationId The id of the medical location where the form was created.
 * @property tags Tags that qualify the form as being member of a certain class.
 * @property codes Codes that identify or qualify this particular form.
 * @property endOfLife Soft delete (unix epoch in ms) timestamp of the object.
 * @property deletionDate Hard delete (unix epoch in ms) timestamp of the object.
 * @property descr Name/basic description of the form
 * @property formTemplateId Id of the form template being used to display the form
 * @property contactId Id of the contact for which the form is being used.
 * @property parent The parent of this form, used to determine the forms hierarchy
 * @property externalUuid A unique external id (from another external source).
 * @property delegations The delegations giving access to all connected healthcare information.
 * @property encryptionKeys The patient secret encryption key used to encrypt the secured properties (like note for example), encrypted for separate Crypto Actors.
 * @property encryptedSelf The encrypted fields of this Form.
 *
