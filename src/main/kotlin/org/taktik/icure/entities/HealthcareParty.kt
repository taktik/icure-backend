 * - StoredICureDocument
 * - Person
 * - Encryptable
 * - CryptoActor
 *
 * @property id the Id of the healthcare party. We encourage using either a v4 UUID or a HL7 Id.
 * @property rev the revision of the healthcare party in the database, used for conflict management / optimistic locking.
 * @property deletionDate hard delete (unix epoch in ms) timestamp of the object.
 * @property name The full name of the healthcare party, used mainly when the healthcare party is an organization
 * @property firstName the firstname (name) of the healthcare party.
 * @property lastName the lastname (surname) of the healthcare party. This is the official lastname that should be used for official administrative purposes.

 * @property financialInstitutionInformation List of financial information (Bank, bank account).
 * @property billingType The invoicing scheme this healthcare party adheres to : 'service fee' or 'flat rate'
 * @property hcPartyKeys When a healthcare party has access to the medical file for modification or has been given access to it (any time he/she acts as a Crypto Actor), the list of exchange keys with other healthcare parties.
 * @property privateKeyShamirPartitions A set of shamir partitions for this healthcare party RSA private keys, encrypted with the public keys of the notaries (referred by their ids). Format is hcpId of key that has been partitioned : "threshold|partition in hex"
 * @property publicKey The public RSA key of this healthcare party
 * @property bankAccount Bank Account identifier of the healhtcare party, IBAN, deprecated, use financial institutions instead
